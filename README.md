You will find in this directory Jupyter notebooks to illustrate concepts and methods in Python (.ipynb files)

### Requirements to run notebooks:

  1) Python (> 3.3), Jupyter notebook and scikit-learn package. It is recommended to install them via <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/downloads">Anaconda Distribution</a>
    which will install these dependencies directly.
  2) *OR* use the mybinder service to run them remotely and interactively (open the link and wait a few seconds for the first connection so that the environment loads):
